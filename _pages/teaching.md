I'm an avid teaching assistant (TA) and member of the <a href='https://datascience.ucsd.edu/'>Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute (HDSI)</a> community. Below are the classes I have TA'ed for:

<h5><a href='https://dsc140a.com/'>DSC 140A</a>: Probabilistic Modeling & Machine Learning (SP24, WI25)</h5>

The course covers learning and using probabilistic models for knowledge representation and decision-making. Topics covered include graphical models, temporal models, and online learning, as well as applications to natural language processing, adversarial learning, computational biology, and robotics.

<h5><a href='https://dsc40a.com/'>DSC 40A</a>: Theoretical Foundations of Data Science I  (FA22)</h5>

The sequence DSC 40A-B introduces the theoretical foundations of data science. DSC 40A, the first course in the sequence, exposes students to the mathematical theory underlying fundamental topics in machine learning. Topics include empirical risk minimization, optimization, regression, classification, and discrete probability. 


<h5><a href='https://dsc40b.com/'>DSC 95</a>: Tutor Apprenticeship in Data Science (SP24)</h5>

Students will receive training in skills and techniques necessary to be effective tutors for data science courses. Students will also gain practical experience in tutoring students on data science topics.
