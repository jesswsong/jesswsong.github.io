Hi! I'm interested in building grounded & applicable machine learning solutions.

I've worked at:
- [Wells Fargo](https://www.wellsfargo.com/) *Data Management*
  - Deployed two automation stratgies grounded in machine learning and pre-trained deep learning models, currently alleviating 20% of process workload per resource.
- [Qualcomm Institute](https://qi.ucsd.edu/) *MEG Center*
  - Developed ensemble learning models to recognize spikes from high-dimensional MEG data. 
- [Franklin Templeton](https://www.franklintempleton.com/) *Digital Assets VC*
  - Built ad-hoc web3 market data dashboards, data pipeline, and automated a cron-job

I have led:
- [research capstone project](https://dsc180-b11-2.github.io/layout-grounded-optimization/) advised by *Dr. Alex Cloninger and Dr. Rayan Saab.*
- [Diversity in Data Science]
- [BAYCSC] development of

My expertise includes:
  - Data mining & traditional machine learning
  - Data visualization & interpretation for business
  - Integrating deep learning models into user-friendly environments

Some of my other interests include journaling, traveling, & boxing.
- üåè Fun fact: I've lived in China, Canada, and the States while growing up.
